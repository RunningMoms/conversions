Judy Mercer Delicious egg bakes for breakfast this am. Once I
make my way through this house I am planning a little 5 k run
with my boy. Have to say, the past three weeks have been
amazing. Scale is not changing BUT I feel great, sleeping great,
and I have lost 2 inches from my waste E. This is huge for me.
At 44 I have been premenopausal for roughly 4 years and my mid
section was growing and growing and growing. Thank you Carey
Adam for your instruction and knowledge.

Alina Wolmar Judy Mercer Sounds wonderful!! I feel
the same about weight, scale not moving, but my figure is
changing. Hubby even commented today while I was
running on the treadmill (had not so much clothes on, lol)
that he can see a big difference. I have more energy at 44
than I had in my 20's!
